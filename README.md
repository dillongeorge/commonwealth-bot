**Still need to make the app pull most recent PDFs from Commonwealth's website!**
**Commonwealth doesn't appear to update their beer list often. The dream is dead :(.**

Follow these steps for dank beer lists: 

1. `npm install`
2. Request slack token from [Slack] (https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot).
2. Run `token=<YOUR_TOKEN> node cw_bot.js`
